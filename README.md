This project is for storing the code for basic algorithm and data structure so that I can refer it back ^_^

Heads-UP:


Also, when you find mistakes (which you will), carefully think through why the bug is occuring.
One of the worst things I saw while interviewing was candidates who recognized a
mistake and tried making “random” changes to fix the error. 

Topics we gonna cover
=============================
knowledge:
Data Structures| Algorithms | Concepts
Linked Lists    |Breadth First Search}   | Bit Manipulation
Binary Trees |    Depth First Search     | Singleton Design Pattern
Tries        |   Binary Search           | Factory Design Pattern
Stacks       | Merge Sort                | Memory (Stack vs Heap)
Queues       |                           | Quick Sort Recursion
Vectors / 
ArrayLists   | Tree Insert / Find        |  etc Big-O Time
Hash Tables  |
